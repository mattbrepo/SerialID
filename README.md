# SerialID
Change the Serial ID of C: disk.

**Language: x86 Assembly**

**Start: 2003**

## Why
This was made out of my desire to brush up on my Assembly skills. It's a utility to change the Serial ID of a C: disk on DOS/Windows computers.

## Example

```
C:\>SerialID A6B2C3D5

Do you want to change C: SerialID: (y/n)?
```
